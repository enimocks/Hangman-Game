# Hangman-Game
JavaScript Hangman Game for HW #3

## About
This project is a basic hangman game -- just like you might play on paper -- written using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The word bank is based on the names of the major houses in the book/TV series: Game of Thrones.

You can play the game [here](https://enimocks.github.io/Hangman-Game/).
