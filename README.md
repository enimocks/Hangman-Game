# Hangman-Game
JavaScript Hangman Game for HW #3

## About
This project is a basic hangman game -- just like you might play on paper -- written using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The word bank is based on the names of the major houses in the book/TV series: Game of Thrones.

You can play the game by [clicking here](https://enimocks.github.io/Hangman-Game/).

## Project Future
Going forward, I would like to add some more elements of the series into the game (i.e. music, more words, pictures, etc.), as well as iron out some inconsistencies in the game mechanics (which I just didn't have time to do).
